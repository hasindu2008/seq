# Publicly available nanopore datasets (with raw data)

This repository keeps track of the links to some useful publicly available nanopore datasets (that includes raw signal data). These datasets include those we generated in-house at Garvan institute and uploaded to SRA and ENA, as well as uploaded to public repositores such as SRA and ENA by others.

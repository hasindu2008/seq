# ONT R9.4.1 chemistry - RNA Data


Following are datasets uploaded by others. Some of them have very old basecalls.
In some of them, raw FAST5 signal files are no longer working with latest Guppy.
I have converted them to [BLOW5 format](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01147-4) and have basecalled using a very recent Guppy through [buttery-eel](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/buttery-eel).

- associated publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0617-2
- raw signal data converted to BLOW5 format can be obtained from [SRR23513622](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&acc=SRR23513622&display=data-access). filename: `na12878_cDNA_blow5.tar` (md5sum: `cba2ce651d8c33528e594a9e45ff6515`)
- Guppy 6.1.3 high accuracy rebasecalled reads (through [buttery-eel wrapper](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/buttery-eel), with dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg model) that passed the default qscore filter: [SRR23513619](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&acc=SRR23513619&display=data-access).

## DNA datasets from Singapore Nanopore-Expression Project (SG-NEx)
- link: https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data
- associated publication: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440736
- raw signal data converted to BLOW5 format can be obtained from [sg-nex-data-blow5 AWS S3 bucket](http://sg-nex-data-blow5.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/). We highly acknowledge [Jonathan GÃ¶ke](https://github.com/jonathangoeke), [Chen Ying](https://github.com/cying111) for being open and hosting BLOW5 files through the AWS Open Data. Please visit [SG-NEx_blow5_tutorial](https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data/blob/master/docs/SG-NEx_blow5_tutorial.md) on how you could use/analyse this data.
- Guppy 6.4.2 rebasecalled reads (through [buttery-eel wrapper](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/buttery-eel)) will be soon made available under [sg-nex-data AWS S3 bucket](http://sg-nex-data.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/).
